# The-Movie-Data-Base

## About Me

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub repository! My name is Obansere Oladapo I., and I am a data enthusiast with a passion for analyzing and visualizing data to uncover interesting insights. In this repository, I've had the opportunity to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies collected from THE_MOVIE_DATA_BASE (TMDb). This dataset includes user ratings, revenue, genres, keywords, cast, and other valuable information about movies.

### Dataset Description

The dataset used for this analysis provides a rich source of information about movies, including details such as genres, keywords, and cast, with some columns containing multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. Additionally, the dataset includes columns that represent budget and revenue figures adjusted for inflation, providing a more accurate understanding of a movie's financial performance over time.

### Research Questions

In this project, I aimed to answer two important research questions:

**RESEARCH QUESTION 1: What are the key attributes or characteristics that tend to be linked with movies that achieve high revenue?"**

To address this question, I delved into the dataset to identify the factors that contribute to a movie's financial success. By analyzing the relationships between variables, I sought to uncover the key properties associated with high-revenue movies.

**RESEARCH QUESTION 2: Is there a significant connection between the duration of a movie and its level of popularity, and can we establish if a movie's runtime directly influences its overall popularity?**

This question explores the relationship between a movie's duration and its level of popularity. Does a longer or shorter runtime influence the movie's reception among viewers? Through data analysis and visualization, I aimed to provide insights into this intriguing connection.

### Analysis Results

I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, and the results of my findings are available in this repository. You can find detailed insights, visualizations, and conclusions related to the research questions I set out to answer. Feel free to explore the code, reports, and visualizations I've created to gain a deeper understanding of the movie industry and its key determinants of success.

I hope you find this analysis informative and insightful. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your input is valuable, and I'm always open to further discussions and collaborations.

Thank you for visiting my repository and exploring the world of movies through data analysis!
